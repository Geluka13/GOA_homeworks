    <h1>Frog</h1>
    <p>A frog is any member of a diverse and largely carnivorous group of short-bodied, tailless amphibians composing the order Anura[1] (coming from the Ancient Greek ἀνούρα, literally 'without tail'). The oldest fossil "proto-frog"</p>

        <img src="./assets/images/frogs.png" alt="frogs" width="500">
        <p>An adult frog has a stout body, protruding eyes, anteriorly-attached tongue, limbs folded underneath, and no tail (the tail of tailed frogs is an extension of the male cloaca). Frogs have glandular skin, with secretions ranging from distasteful to toxic. Their skin varies in colour from well-camouflaged dappled brown, grey and green to vivid patterns of bright red or yellow and black to show toxicity and ward off predators. Adult frogs live in fresh water and on dry land; some species are adapted for living underground or in trees.</p>
