        <h1>Ryzen</h1>
        <p>Ryzen (/ˈraɪzən/, RY-zən)[3] is a brand[4] of multi-core x86-64 microprocessors designed and marketed by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) for desktop, mobile, server, and embedded platforms based on the Zen microarchitecture. It consists of central processing units (CPUs) marketed for mainstream, enthusiast, server, and workstation segments and accelerated processing units (APUs) marketed for mainstream and entry-level segments and embedded systems applications.</p>

    <main>
        <p>Ryzen uses the "Zen" CPU microarchitecture, a redesign that returned AMD to the high-end CPU market after a decade of near-total absence since 2006.[5] AMD's primary competitor Intel had largely dominated this market segment starting from the 2006 release of their Core microarchitecture and the Core 2 Duo.[6] Similarly, Intel had abandoned their prior Pentium 4 lineup, as its NetBurst microarchitecture was uncompetitive with AMD's Athlon XP in terms of price and efficiency, and with Athlon 64 & 64 X2 they were outmatched in terms of raw performance as well.[7]

            Until Ryzen's initial launch in early 2017, Intel's market dominance over AMD continued to grow with the launch of the now famous "Intel Core" CPU lineup and branding, as well as the successful rollout of their now well-known "tick-tock" CPU release strategy. That new strategy was most famous for alternating between a new CPU microarchitecture and a new fabrication node each year. Intel followed that release cadence for almost a decade, starting with Intel Core's initial Q3 2006 launch of 65 nm Conroe and continuing until the release of the 14 nm Broadwell desktop CPUs, which were delayed a year from a planned 2014 launch to Q3 2015. That delay necessitated a refresh of their pre-existing 22 nm Haswell CPU lineup in the form of "Devil's Canyon", and thus officially ended "tick-tock" as a practice.[8][9] Those events proved to be incredibly important for AMD, as Intel's inability to further sustain "tick-tock" was critically important in providing both the initial and continually growing market openings for AMD's Ryzen CPUs and, indeed the Zen CPU microarchitecture as a whole to succeed.</p>

        <p>Also of note is the release of AMD's Bulldozer microarchitecture in 2011, which despite being a ground up CPU design like Zen, had been designed and optimized for parallel computing above all else, leading to starkly inferior real-world performance in any workload that was not highly multi-threaded, which was still the case for the vast majority at that time. This caused it to be woefully uncompetitive in essentially every area outside of raw multi-thread performance and its use in low power APUs with integrated Radeon graphics.[10] Despite a die shrink and several revisions of the Bulldozer architecture, performance and power efficiency failed to catch up with Intel's competing products.[11] Consequently, all of this forced AMD to completely abandon the entire high-end CPU market (including desktop, laptops, and server/enterprise) until Ryzen's release in 2017.</p>
