        <p>August "Auggie" Pullman is a 10-year-old boy living in Brooklyn with his parents, Isabel and Nate, older sister, Olivia "Via", and their dog, Daisy. Auggie was born with a rare medical facial deformity, mandibulofacial dysostosis, and has been homeschooled by Isabel, but as he approaches fifth grade, she and Nate enroll him at Beecher Prep, a private middle school. When the school year begins, Auggie is ostracized, but he soon forms a close friendship with a classmate, Jack Will.</p>

    <p> For Halloween, Auggie dresses as Ghostface from the previous year when Daisy ruins his planned Boba Fett costume. While entering his homeroom, Auggie overhears Jack, who does not recognize him, joining Julian Albans, the class bully, and his friends, Amos Conti, Miles Noury, and Henry Joplin, in making fun of Auggie behind his back. Auggie feigns sick, forcing his mother to abandon her mother-daughter day with Via to pick him up. Though she is hurt, Via convinces Auggie to go trick-or-treating with her, as she has been rejected by her own best friend, Miranda Navas.</p>
