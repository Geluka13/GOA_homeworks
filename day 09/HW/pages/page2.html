        <p>Rugby union football, commonly known simply as <b>rugby union</b> or more often just <i>rugby</i> , is a close-contact team sport that originated at <u>Rugby School in England in the first half of the 19th century</u>. Rugby is based on running with the ball in hand. In its most common form, a game is played between two teams of 15 players each, using an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular field called a pitch.
