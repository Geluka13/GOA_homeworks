Known for their majestic appearance, powerful presence, and complex social structures, lions have captured the imagination of cultures throughout history. Their awe-inspiring beauty and strength, along with their important role in ecosystems, make them one of the most fascinating creatures in the animal kingdom.</p>

        <p>Lions (Panthera leo) are the second-largest big cats, after tigers, and are instantly recognizable by their muscular bodies, large heads, and, in the case of males, their impressive manes. The mane of a lion is one of its most distinctive features. It is not only a symbol of maturity and strength but also provides protection during fights. The color and size of a lion's mane can vary based on age, genetics, and even environmental factors, with darker manes often being a sign of a healthier, more dominant lion.</p>
        <section>
            <p>Females, or lionesses, do not have manes but share the same strong, muscular build. Their coats are usually a tawny yellow-brown, which helps them blend seamlessly into the grassy savannas and dry forests of their native habitats. Lions have sharp claws and teeth that are designed for hunting and self-defense, and their eyes, large and expressive, are adapted to detect movement even in low light, which aids them in hunting at dawn or dusk.</p>

            <p>Unlike most other big cats, lions are social animals, living in groups called prides. A pride typically consists of several related females, their offspring, and a small number of males. Lion prides are highly cooperative, and much of their success as predators comes from their ability to work together. The lionesses, usually the primary hunters, work in coordination to stalk and bring down prey, while the males protect the pride's territory from intruders and potential rivals.</p>
