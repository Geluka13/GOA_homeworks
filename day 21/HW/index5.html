            <p>Tolkien was born in Bloemfontein, South Africa, to English parents, but after the death of his father, the family returned to England when he was just a child. Growing up in the English countryside, Tolkien developed a love for languages, nature, and mythology. He studied at Exeter College, Oxford, where he developed a deep interest in philology (the study of languages) and ancient texts, which would profoundly influence his later writing.</p>

            <p>Tolkien’s academic career flourished at Oxford, where he became a professor of Anglo-Saxon (Old English) at Pembroke College. His scholarly expertise in medieval literature and mythology, particularly the Beowulf epic, would play a pivotal role in shaping the mythical worlds he would later create in his fiction.</p>
