    <h1>Batman</h1>
<p>Batman, one of the most iconic superheroes in popular culture, first appeared in DC Comics in 1939. Created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, Bruce Wayne—Batman’s alter ego—embodies the struggle between good and evil in a city plagued by crime. Unlike many superheroes, Batman does not possess superhuman powers; instead, he relies on his intelligence, physical prowess, and an array of high-tech gadgets.

    The character is defined by his tragic origin story: the murder of his parents in front of him as a child, which fuels his quest for justice. This trauma shapes Bruce into the Dark Knight, a vigilante who operates outside the law to combat Gotham City's criminal underworld. Batman's rogues' gallery is one of the most formidable in comic book history, featuring villains like the Joker, Catwoman, and the Riddler, each representing different facets of chaos and morality.
    
    Batman's dual identity explores themes of vengeance, justice, and sacrifice. He grapples with his own darkness while striving to be a symbol of hope for Gotham’s citizens. The character's complexity is further enhanced by his relationships with allies like Robin and Alfred, as well as his complicated dynamics with fellow heroes and villains.
    
    Over the decades, Batman has transcended comic books, appearing in numerous films, animated series, and video games, each interpretation adding layers to his mythology. From Tim Burton's gothic vision to Christopher Nolan's grounded realism, Batman continues to resonate with audiences, proving that even in darkness, one can find the strength to fight for what is right.</p>
